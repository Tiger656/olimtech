The following exercise contains the following subjects:
‚óè Array
Instructions
For each of the questions below, answer the questions with this
array:
const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"]; */
//1. Using a loop, iterate through this array and console.log all of the people.
for (let person of people) {
    console.log(person);
}
//2. Write the command to remove "Greg" from the array.
const indexGreg = people.indexOf("Greg");
if (indexGreg !== -1) {
    people.splice(indexGreg, 1);
}
//3. Write the command to remove "James" from the array.
const indexJames = people.indexOf("James");
if (indexJames !== -1) {
    people.splice(indexJames, 1);
}
//4. Write the command to add "Matt" to the front of the array.
people.unshift("Matt");
//5. Write the command to add your name to the end of the
//array.
people.push("Tim");
//6. Using a loop, iterate through this array, and after
// console.log "Mary", exit from the loop.
for (let person of people) {
    console.log(person);
    if (person === "Mary") {
        console.log("Mary");
        break;
    }
}
// 7. Write the command to make a copy of the array using a
// slice. The copy should NOT include "Mary" or "Matt".
const peopleCopy = people.slice(1, 4);
// 8. Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Mary"
// is located.
const indexOfMary = people.indexOf("Mary");
// 9. Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Foo" is
// located (this should return -1).
const indexOfFoo = people.indexOf("Foo")
// 10. Redefine the people variable with the value you started
// with. Using the splice command, remove "Devon" from
// the array and add "Elizabeth"
// and "Artie". Your array should look like this when you are
// done ["Greg", "Mary", "Elizabeth", "Artie",
// "James"].
people.splice(2, 1, "Elizabeth", "Artie");
// 11. Create a new variable called withBob and set it equal
// to the people array concatenated with the string of "Bob"
const withBob = people.concat("Bob");
